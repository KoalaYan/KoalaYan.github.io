# About Me

* I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn), at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Haibing Guan](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=102) and [Tao Song](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=424).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
* I was a Research Intern at Intel, working on WebNN-based large language model execution frameworks to improve performance and resource efficiency.
* My research interests lie in robustness, efficiency, and practical deployment of federated learning systems, with applications to Web 3.0 and large language models.
